# UFeels - Emotion Tracking Android App

![Logo](/Readme-Screenshots/image-18.png)

## Project Overview

**UFeels** is an Android application designed to help users track, categorize, and reflect on their emotions. With a privacy-first, offline approach, UFeels allows users to log and analyze their feelings without needing registration or data sharing. The app offers a unique take on emotional tracking, providing options for custom emotion categorization and insightful data visualization.

> _"What is a feeling, and how should it be categorized?"_ - UFeels tackles this complex question by allowing users to define and track their emotions in a way that suits them, rather than following rigid psychological classifications.

## Key Features

- **Emotion Tracking**: Users can log their emotions with timestamps, location (optional), and custom categories.
- **Data Visualization**: Emotions are visualized over time, allowing users to identify patterns and triggers.
- **Custom Categorization System**: Users can define their own emotional categories, moving beyond traditional "positive" or "negative" labels.
- **Offline-First Design**: Data is stored locally, ensuring user privacy without requiring cloud storage or user accounts.
- **Monetization**: In-app purchases are available through the Google Billing API, allowing for a monetized, ad-free experience.

## How UFeels Works

UFeels was developed to address some of the challenges involved in emotional self-tracking:

1. **Defining Feelings**: The app encourages users to differentiate between mind-related emotions (e.g., joy, anger) and physical states (e.g., hunger, fatigue).
2. **Flexible Categorization**: UFeels doesn’t limit users to standard categorizations of emotions; instead, it allows for personal, subjective categorization.
3. **Enhanced Self-Reflection**: The app is designed to discourage default responses (like "I’m fine") that can make self-development data less meaningful.

## Concept Insights and Research

The journey to create UFeels involved exploring various perspectives on emotions and how to categorize them. Here are some unique considerations that guided its development:

- **What Constitutes a "Feeling"?**: The app differentiates between emotions related to mental states (e.g., happiness, anger) and physical conditions (e.g., hunger, fatigue).
- **Categorization Flexibility**: Psychological interpretations often label emotions as positive or negative, but UFeels allows users to interpret their emotions subjectively.
- **Response Authenticity**: Common responses like "I’m fine" are minimized through the app’s design, encouraging genuine reflections for meaningful data.
