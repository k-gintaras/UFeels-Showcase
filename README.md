# UFeels - Emotion Tracking Android App

## Project Overview

**UFeels** is an Android application designed to help users track, categorize, and reflect on their emotions. With a privacy-first, offline approach, UFeels allows users to log and analyze their feelings without needing registration or data sharing. The app offers a unique take on emotional tracking, providing options for custom emotion categorization and insightful data visualization.

> _"What is a feeling, and how should it be categorized?"_ - UFeels tackles this complex question by allowing users to define and track their emotions in a way that suits them, rather than following rigid psychological classifications.

## How UFeels Works

UFeels was developed to address some of the challenges involved in emotional self-tracking:

1. **Defining Feelings**: The app encourages users to differentiate between mind-related emotions (e.g., joy, anger) and physical states (e.g., hunger, fatigue).
2. **Flexible Categorization**: UFeels doesn’t limit users to standard categorizations of emotions; instead, it allows for personal, subjective categorization.
3. **Enhanced Self-Reflection**: The app is designed to discourage default responses (like "I’m fine") that can make self-development data less meaningful.

## Concept Insights and Research

The journey to create UFeels involved exploring various perspectives on emotions and how to categorize them. Here are some unique considerations that guided its development:

- **What Constitutes a "Feeling"?**: The app differentiates between emotions related to mental states (e.g., happiness, anger) and physical conditions (e.g., hunger, fatigue).
- **Categorization Flexibility**: Psychological interpretations often label emotions as positive or negative, but UFeels allows users to interpret their emotions subjectively.
- **Response Authenticity**: Common responses like "I’m fine" are minimized through the app’s design, encouraging genuine reflections for meaningful data.
